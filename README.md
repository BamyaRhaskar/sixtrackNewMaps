New maps to be implemented in SixTrack. Versions in this repository are to be in both C and Fortran. 

Current Status as of 12:00pm, Pacific Time Zone (UTC-08:00) on August 21, 2015:
	-Currently, maps implemented in C so far are: RFmultipole, Exact Bend, and Thick Dipole.
	-Benchmark programs available for RF Multipole. Exact Bend and Thick Dipole are to be developed. 
	-There is an obsolete folder, where different versions of the final scripts can be viewed. These
	 versions have not been benchmarked, unless indicated within the comments of that version.

To view most recent work, completed after 12:00pm, Pacific Time Zone (UTC-08:00) on August 21, 2015:
	Please direct yourself to the directory named 'RightNow', within sixtrackNewMaps. Here you 
	will find all up-to-date files, with proper corresponding benchmark statistics, as well as a 
	seperate benchmarking folder, containing the most recent (possibly modified)
